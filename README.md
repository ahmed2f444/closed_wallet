# closed-wallet
A closed wallet (or closed-loop wallet) is a digital payment system where money can only be used within a specific company's ecosystem. Unlike open wallets like PayPal or Apple Pay, which work across multiple platforms, closed wallets are limited to the issuing company's products or services.
